Hi there! I'm Eugene Wang. I am currently a Master's student in Computer Engineering at New York University. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Chemistry from National Taiwan University in 2014.

This Summer, I joined [Shopee](https://shopee.tw/) as a Data Scientist Intern, developing an AI system for dynamic pricing. 

I am actively looking for 2021 Summer New Grad Software Engineer positions, if you have any opportunity, feel free to contact me through my [Email](mailto:yjwang.y56@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/y56/). 

Thanks for stopping by!
